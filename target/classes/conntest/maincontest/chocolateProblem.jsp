<h3><b>Problem Statement:</b></h3>
<p>
<span class="description">
A child goes to the shop to buy chocolates. The shopkeeper, 
"I have one chocolate for Rs 0.50, however, if you return 5 chocolate wrappers, 
I will give you 1 extra chocolate".
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="description">
The child bought 18 chocolates of Rs 9. After eating, he returns 15 wrappers and 
gets 3 more chocolates from the shopkeeper. Now, the child is having 6 wrappers in total, 
which includes 3 previously eaten chocolates and 3, which he got from the shopkeeper after
 returning 15 chocolate wrappers.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="description">
Again, the child returns 5 chocolate wrappers out of 6 and gets 1 more chocolate from 
the shopkeeper and left with 1 wrapper in his hand. So, the child got a total number 
of 22 chocolates from the shopkeeper and remains with 1 wrapper.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="description">
Write a program for the above situation, if the child gives a floating amount (in Rs) to 
the shopkeeper then, the 0th position of integer array should give the output of maximum 
number of chocolates received from the shopkeeper and 1st position of integer array should 
give the minimum number of remaining chocolate wrappers.
</span>
</p>

<h4><b>Output:</b></h4>
<p>
<span class="description">Output should be integer array of size 2.</span>
</p>
<b>Example:</b><br>
<div class="description">
Input: 9.0 (float)<br>
<br>
OutPut: {29,3} (int[])
</div>
<br>
<b>Instructions :</b><br>
<div class="description">
1. Don't write main function<br>
2. Output should be specified return type<br>
3. Do not change the class name, function name and previous return code.<br>
4. When submit contest, 10 different test cases applied to your return code and from passing test cases the result will be calculated.<br>
5. Don't change or minimize the window, if you do, the result will be submit with score 0.
6.Don't try to move from this tab,
